\section{Introduction}

Neural networks have become a powerful machine learning tool, with strong results in many areas such as image classification and reinforcement learning. However, using deterministic weights makes the algorthms unable to model the uncertainty in the data, thus making overly confident predictions and leading to overfitting.

Several methods have been proposed to address this issue, such as earling stopping, dropout, and L2 regularization. While these techniques are useful, they do not provide a way to model uncertainty. Bayes by Backprop is instead a Bayesian inference approach that models the uncertainty in the weights of the neural network, making them a probability distribution over values rather than a single number. This leads to a model which can be considered as an ensemble of models, each of which has its weights sampled from the learnt distribution. This uncertainity in the weights can be used in reinforcement learning to introduce more variability in the decions made, leading naturally to exploration of the decision space.

\section{Being Bayesian by Backpropagation}

In Bayesian inference for neural networks, weights are a posterior distribution learnt during training. During the inference phase, the actual weights are sampled from this distribution. So each possible configuration of the weights is a possible model, thus taking expectations for making predictions is equivalent as using an infinitely large ensemble of models, each with its own weights sampled from the posterior distribution.

Variational learning is the process of finding the parameters $\theta$ of the weight distribution which minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence with the true posterior distribution. This is done by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data given the model. The ELBO can be expressed as:

\[
    F(D, \theta) = KL[q(w | \theta) || P(w)] - \mathbb{E}_{q(w | \theta)}[\log P(D | w)]
\]

The first term is the KL divergence between the approximate posterior distribution $q(w | \theta)$ and the prior distribution $P(w)$, while the second term is the expected log-likelihood of the data given the weights. The first one encourages the approximate posterior to be close to the prior, while the second one encourages the weights to be such that the data is well explained by the model.

\subsection{Unbiased Monte Carlo gradients}

Minimizing exactly the ELBO is computationally unfeasible, thus gradient descent and various approximations are used. By using Monte Carlo sampling to evaluate the expectations and applying the re-parametrization trick for optimizing the ELBO, the algorithm Bayes by Backprop is obtained.

Previous work mentioned in the paper has used the re-parametrization trick to learn the parameters of stochastic hiddend units, but this paper extends the algorithm to the weights of the neural network, making this optimization problem several orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, the paper approximates the exact cost to

\[
    F(D, \theta) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log q(w^{(i)} | \theta) - \log P(w^{(i)}) - \log P(D | w^{(i)})
\]

All the terms depend on the Monte Carlo sampled weights $w^{(i)}$, which is a variance reduction technique called common random numbers.
% In contrast to the closed form solution, the gradients of this cost are only affected by the parts of the posterior distribution characterised by the weight samples.

\subsection{Gaussian variational posterior}

Since the cost function is approximated instead of being computed exactly starting from a Gaussian hypothesis, the prior and posterior distributions are not necessarily Gaussian.

The posterior distribution of the weights is modeled by a noise free diagonal Gaussian distribution with two degrees of freedom per weight. This only doubles the number of parameters while giving a good level of uncertainty to the weights. Using the re-parametrization trick, the weights are sampled and used to perform the forward pass of the neural network. The gradients of the cost function are then computed using the cost function described above, and the parameters of the posterior distribution are updated using gradient descent.

\subsection{Scale mixture prior}

The prior distribution is a fixed scale mixture of Gaussians with its hyperparameters chosen during tuning. The paper argues that optimizing the prior distribution during training leads to worse results because it learns to fit poor initial parameters quickly and falls into a local minima. Also in literature this is a debated topic, with criticism on its validity and usefulness.

The form of the prior distribution is as follows:

\[
    P(w) = \prod_{j} \pi N(w_j | 0, \sigma_1^2) + (1 - \pi) N(w_j | 0, \sigma_2^2)
\]

where $\pi$ is the mixing parameter which controls the proportion of the two Gaussian distributions, $w_j$ is the $j$-th weight of the neural network and $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the standard deviations of the two Gaussian distributions. By giving the first component a larger variance, the prior distribution resembles a spike-and-slab distribution.

\subsection{Minibatches and KL re-weighting}

The ELBO cost function can be used in minibatch optimization by re-weighting the KL divergence term. There are two proposal of weights, the first one being

\[
    \frac{1}{M} KL[q(w | \theta) || P(w)]
\]

where $M$ is the number of minibatches; the second one is

\[
    \pi_i KL[q(w | \theta) || P(w)]
\]

where $\pi_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th minibatch. This allows placing non uniform weights on the minibatches, and the paper proposes the following form of $\pi_i$:
\[
    \pi_i = \frac{2^{M-i}}{2^M-1}
\]

This leads to the KL having more importance in the first iterations thus giving more importance to the prior. In the subsequent minibatches progressively its weight is reduced, giving more importance to the log-likelihood term and subsequently to the data.

\section{Contextual Bandits}

Contextual bandits are a reinforcement learning problem where an agent is presented with a context and a set of choices which lead to different rewards. The agent must learn to choose the best action based on the context and the rewards received, but the context has to be independent of previous contexts, actions and rewards. It is also important to note that the agent does not have access the information on the rewards of the actions not taken, which is a problem known as "the absence of counterfactual".

During training, the agent build a model of the distribution of the rewards conditioned on actions and context, and this distribution can be modelled by a neural network. This network has to be trained not only to choose simply the best action based on the observations, but also to explore the action space otherwise the agent can under-explore and miss more rewarding actions.

One technique that allows to trade between exploration and best choices is Thompson sampling. At each step, new parameters are drawn and the action relative to those parameter is chosen. This is a kind of stochastic hypothesis testing and it usually requires the model parameters to be Bayesian. This process can easily be adapted to neural network and Bayes by Backprop, with the size of Monte Carlo sampling ruling the variance in gradient estimates and thus the trade-off between exploration and best choices. At the beginning of the training, the posterior is close to the prior, thus the actions are taken uniformily. As training progresses, the posterior distribution converges and the uncertainity on many parameters decreases, allowing more deterministic choices. In literature it is known that variatonal methods under-explore, but the paper argues that this didn't happen in their experiments.

\section{Reproduction of the MNIST classification experiment}

In this section I will describe the reproduction of the MNIST classification experiment proposed in the paper.

\subsection{Dataset and data preprocessing}

The MNIST dataset is a well known dataset of handwritten digits, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, and the task is to classify the digit in the image from 0 to 9 included.

The images are preprocessed by flattening them and dividing the pixel values by 126 as described in the paper. Subsequently, the training dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 validation images.

\subsection{Model}

The model consists of two Bayesian layers with ReLU activation function, each with 1200 hidden units, and a third layer with 10 softmax output units. The implementation of the model follows as much as possible the DRY principle, with the model, layers, prior and posterior distributions being defined in separate classes and their behaviour implemented in parametrized methods.

\subsection{Training}

Minibatch stochastic gradient descent is used to train the model by using the Adam optimizer, with batch size 128. The log-likelihood cost is the cross-entropy between the predicted distribution and the true distribution of the labels, as described in the paper. The weight of the KL divergence term is set to the first option, which is $\frac{1}{M}$, where $M$ is the number of minibatches.

Hyperparameter tuning is done using a grid search on the parameters listed in the paper, with the following values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate: $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$, $10^{-5}$
    \item Prior mixing parameter $\pi$: $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{4}$
    \item Prior 1 negative log standard deviation $- \log \sigma_1$: $0$, $1$, $2$
    \item Prior 2 negative log standard deviation $- \log \sigma_2$: $6$, $7$, $8$
    \item Number of Monte Carlo samples: $1$, $2$, $3$, $5$
\end{itemize}
The values are the very same as in the paper, except for the number of Monte Carlo samples. I found 10 to always perform worse, so I changed the 10 to a 3 to allow finer selection in lower values.

The best hyperparameters found are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate: $10^{-3}$
    \item Prior mixing parameter $\pi$: $\frac{1}{2}$
    \item Prior 1 negative log standard deviation $- \log \sigma_1$: $0$
    \item Prior 2 negative log standard deviation $- \log \sigma_2$: $6$
    \item Number of Monte Carlo samples: $3$
\end{itemize}

The model is then trained for 50 epochs on the whole training dataset of 60,000 images, and the test error on every epoch is represented in Figure \ref{fig:mnist-test-error}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{asi_mnist_test_error.png}
    \caption{Test error on the MNIST dataset.}
    \label{fig:mnist-test-error}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion and problems encountered}

The results are similar in shape to the ones presented in the paper, but they differ of 1 order of magnitude in the values. Training for more epochs did not lead to better results, and the model was clearing overfitting and reaching up to 40\% test error rate. This is likely due to implementation details and tricks that the authors used to improve the performance.

Another aspect that was not mentioned in the paper is the weight initialization. The authors do not specify how the weights are initialized and some of them lead to very poor results, even random guessing (90\% test error rate). After some trial and error, I found that initializing the weights with a normal distribution with arbitrary mean and standard deviation proportional to the size of the layer was a good choice.

Additionally, the two different ways to compute the KL divergence weight in the cost function are not interchangeable. While the first one leads to a good performance most of the times, the second one sometimes even leads to exploding gradients and model parameters going to $NaN$. Due to this behaviour, I decided to use the first one only.

% of space.


% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}


% These instructions apply to everyone.


% \subsection{Citations within the text}


% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
% author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
% format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
% used consistently.


% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%     \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
% use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%     Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}


% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
% following before loading the \verb+neurips_2024+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}


% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional

% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2024}
% \end{verbatim}


% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
% person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
% previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
% (e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
% citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.


% \subsection{Footnotes}


% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
% footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


% \subsection{Figures}


% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%     \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}


% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
% purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
% the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
% proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
% paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
% color.


% \subsection{Tables}


% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
% title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.


% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
% strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
% typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%     \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% \begin{table}
%     \caption{Sample table title}
%     \label{sample-table}
%     \centering
%     \begin{tabular}{lll}
%         \toprule
%         \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%         \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%         Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%         \midrule
%         Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%         Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%         Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%         \bottomrule
%     \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{Math}
% Note that display math in bare TeX commands will not create correct line numbers for submission. Please use LaTeX (or AMSTeX) commands for unnumbered display math. (You really shouldn't be using \$\$ anyway; see \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to} and \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40492/what-are-the-differences-between-align-equation-and-displaymath} for more information.)

% \subsection{Final instructions}

% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
% particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
% fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
% numbered.


% \section{Preparing PDF files}


% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''


% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.


% \begin{itemize}


%     \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


%     \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%           menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%           also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%           available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


%     \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%           "solid" shapes instead.


%     \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%           the equivalent AMS Fonts:
%           \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
%           followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
%           for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
%           workaround for reals, natural and complex:
%           \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
%           Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


% \end{itemize}


% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.


% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.

% \begin{ack}
%     Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
%     go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
%     funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
%     More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.


%     Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to automatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
% \end{ack}

% \section*{References}


% References follow the acknowledgments in the camera-ready paper. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
% the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
% consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
% when listing the references.
% Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.

%           % \item {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.}
% \end{itemize}

% {\bf The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.} They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

% The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "\answerYes{}" is generally preferable to "\answerNo{}", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "\answerNo{}" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "\answerNo{}" or "\answerNA{}" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer \answerYes{} to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

% IMPORTANT, please:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item {\bf Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading ``NeurIPS paper checklist"},
%     \item  {\bf Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.}
%     \item {\bf Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers}.

% %%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


% \begin{enumerate}

%     \item {\bf Claims}
%     \item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
%               \item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
%               \item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
%               \item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Limitations}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
%               \item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
%               \item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
%               \item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
%               \item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
%               \item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
%               \item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
%               \item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Theory Assumptions and Proofs}
%     \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
%               \item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
%               \item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
%               \item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
%               \item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
%               \item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experimental Result Reproducibility}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
%               \item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
%               \item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
%               \item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
%                     \begin{enumerate}
%                         \item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
%                         \item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
%                         \item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
%                         \item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
%                     \end{enumerate}
%           \end{itemize}


%     \item {\bf Open access to data and code}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
%               \item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%               \item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
%               \item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%               \item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
%               \item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
%               \item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
%               \item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
%           \end{itemize}


%     \item {\bf Experimental Setting/Details}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
%               \item The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experiment Statistical Significance}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
%               \item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
%               \item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
%               \item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
%               \item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
%               \item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96\% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
%               \item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
%               \item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experiments Compute Resources}
%     \item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
%               \item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
%               \item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Code Of Ethics}
%     \item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics \url{https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines}?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
%               \item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
%               \item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
%           \end{itemize}


%     \item {\bf Broader Impacts}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
%               \item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
%               \item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
%               \item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
%               \item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
%               \item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Safeguards}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
%               \item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
%               \item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
%               \item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Licenses for existing assets}
%     \item[] Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
%               \item The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
%               \item The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
%               \item The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
%               \item For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
%               \item If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, \url{paperswithcode.com/datasets} has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
%               \item For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
%               \item If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf New Assets}
%     \item[] Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}

%               \item Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
%               \item The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
%               \item At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects}
%     \item[] Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
%               \item Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
%               \item According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
%               \item Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
%               \item We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
%               \item For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
